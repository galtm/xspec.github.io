title = "About XSpec"
+++

XSpec is a unit test and [behaviour-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) (BDD) framework for XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron. It is based on the Spec framework of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), which is a BDD framework for Ruby.

XSpec consists of a syntax for describing the behaviour of XSLT, XQuery, or Schematron code, and some code that enables you to test the code against those descriptions.
